## Description

You KanKan Do It! This web application demonstrates my skills as a 
full stack developer, using JWT for authentication to then access a
KanKan Board that stores to LocalStorage. Users input their information 
into the form, then after authentication are redirected to the KanKan Board.
Throughout the development of this application, I gained hands-on experience
JWT Authentication, Full-stack development, and Sequelize for Postgres.
This project aims to provide a secure user experience, highlighting
JWT Authentication, Postgres implementation and LocalStorage.
